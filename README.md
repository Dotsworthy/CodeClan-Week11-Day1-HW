# A CodeClan homework for week 11 day 1
based on the following brief:

## Homework - Simple Classes
Create 3 single classes with methods to perform some functionality.

This is a TDD exercise. Write the test first then create the method to get the test passing.

## MVP:

### Calculator
- Create a Calculator class. This should have functions for Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide. Your methods should take in two ints to perform the calculations on (except the Divide method. This should take two doubles as arguments).

### Water Bottle
- Create a water bottle class with a volume property.
- The volume should start at 100.
- Add a drink function that takes 10 from the volume each time it is called.
- Create an empty function that brings the volume down to 0.
- Create a fill function that fills the volume back to 100.
